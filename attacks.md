# Common phases of the attack

## 1. Foot Printing/Reconnaissance

This is the step where we want to get as much information about our opponent without being intrusive. Things like target address ranges, namespace acquisitions, and information that will be beneficial in deeper attacks.

## 2. Scanning

This is where we want to assess our opponent’s systems. What operating system do they use? What ports are they listening on? We are looking for vulnerable places to enter into their systems.

## 3. Enumeration

Next, we go a little deeper in our attacks to attempt to identify valid user accounts or poorly protected network shares.

## 4. Gaining Access

Now that we have some information, we begin to attempt to access our opponent’s computers.

## 5. Escalating Privilege

If we have gained a low-level user account, we will now escalate our privilege to that of an administrator equivalency.

## 6. Creating Backdoors/Maintaining Access

We do not want to loose our access to our opponent’s machines; hence, we create backdoors to come back in with privileged access.

## 7. Covering Your Tracks

Not getting caught, or not having our “new” accounts be erased is important, so we need to hide our activities.
