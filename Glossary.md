# Glossary of the Internet



**Anonymous FTP** : A method by which computer files are made available for downloading by the general public

**awk** : A programming language designed for working with strings.

**backdoors** : An undocumented way of gaining access to a program, online service or an entire computer system.

**Baud** : bits per second, used to describe the rate at which computers exchange information.

**BIOS** : basic input/output system. The built-in software that determines what a computer can do without accessing programs from a disk. On PCs, the BIOS contains all the code required to control the keyboard, display screen, disk drives, serial communications, and a number of miscellaneous functions. The BIOS is typically placed in a ROM chip that comes with the computer.

**blog (weblogs)** : Web page that serves as a publicly accessible personal journal for an individual.

**Boolean logic** : Boolean logic is a form of algebra in which all values are reduced to either TRUE or FALSE. Boolean logic is especially important for computer science because it fits nicely with the binary numbering system, in which each bit has a value of either 1 or 0. Another way of looking at it is that each bit has a value of either TRUE or FALSE.

**Boot sector** : The first sector of the hard disk where the master boot records resides, which is a small program that is executed when a computer boots up.

**cache** : Pronounced cash, a special high-speed storage mechanism. It can be either a reserved section of main memory or an independent high-speed storage device. Two types of caching are commonly used in personal computers: memory caching and disk caching.

**Client** : a program on a local computer that is used to exchange data with a remote computer, see server.

**cluster / allocation unit** : A group of disk sectors. The operating system assigns a unique number to each cluster and then keeps track of files according to which clusters they use.

**cookies** : A message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message in a text file. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.

**CRC** : Cyclical redundancy check.

**cyclical redundancy check (CRC)** : a common technique for detecting data transmission errors. Transmitted messages are divided into predetermined lengths that are divided by a fixed divisor. According to the calculation, the remainder number is appended onto and sent with the message. When the message is received, the computer recalculates the remainder and compares it to the transmitted remainder. If the numbers do not match, an error is detected.

**DHCP** : Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.

**Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)** : A technology that allows the simultaneous transmission of voice and high-speed data using traditional telephone lines.

**DNS** : Domain Name Server.

**Domain Name Server (DNS)** : A service that translates domain names into IP addresses. domain names** : A name that identifies one or more IP addresses. For example, the domain name microsoft.com represents about a dozen IP addresses. Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages. For example, in the URL http://www.pcwebopedia.com/index.html, the domain name is pcwebopedia.com. Every domain name has a suffix that indicates which top level domain (TLD) it belongs to. There are only a limited number of such domains. For example:

.gov - Government agencies
.edu - Educational institutions
.org - Organizations (nonprofit)
.com - Commercial Business
.net - Network organizations 

Because the Internet is based on IP addresses, not domain names, every Web server requires a Domain Name System (DNS) server to translate domain names into IP addresses.

**ports** : An interface on a computer to which you can connect a device. Personal computers have various types of ports. Internally, there are several ports for connecting disk drives, display screens, and keyboards. Externally, personal computers have ports for connecting modems, printers, mice, and other peripheral devices.

**POTS** : Plain old telephone service.

**ppp** : Point-to-Point Protocol, a method of connecting a computer to the Internet. PPP is more stable than the older SLIP protocol and provides error checking features.

**privileged access** : A privilege to use computer information in some manner. For example, a user might be granted read access to a file, meaning that the user can read the file but cannot modify or delete it. Most operating systems have several different types of access privileges that can be granted or denied to specific users or groups of users.

**rootkits** : malware that creates a method to retain access to a machine.

**router** : A device that forwards data packets along networks. A router is connected to at least two networks, commonly two LANs or WANs or a LAN and its ISP’s network. Routers are located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect. Routers use headers and forwarding tables to determine the best path for forwarding the packets, and they use protocols such as ICMP to communicate with each other and configure the best route between any two hosts.

**routing table** : In internet working, the process of moving a packet of data from source to destination. Routing is usually performed by a dedicated device called a router.

For hard disks, each platter is divided into tracks, and a single track location that cuts through all platters (and both sides of each platter) is called a cylinder. Hard disks have many thousands of cylinders.
