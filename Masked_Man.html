    Being Anonymous doesn’t just end with wearing a mask… Our name comes from its own definition. </br> Anonymity is
    necessary to us for protection purposes. </br> Without this, we fall, and ourwhole life with it, perhaps the life of
    your loved ones too… </br> If you choose the voice of Anonymous, then master the art of anonymity. </br> There is no
    room for fame on this path..

    An anonymous voice has an impact beyond the reach of any possible judgment by our conscience. </br> We cannot
    categorize an idea that has no owner. Each word become true and echo in themselves.

<h2 id="behavior">1. Behavior</h2>
<p><code>Always remember that YOU are your worse enemy's</code></p>
<p>As long as you follow common sense like;</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><strong>Never do anything hacking related outside of your hacking environment</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Never do any of your normal computer usage inside your hacking environment</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Never mention any information about your real life when talking with other hackers</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Never brag about your illegal hacking exploits to friends in real life</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>If you follow these rules, then you can pretty much do whatever you want with less risk of being in such
        situations you dont want.</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Privacy is the ability to keep things to yourself by choice, while anonymity means that you want people to
            see what you do, just not your identity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Always keep in mind that you dont know who is behind the screen; <strong>wearing the picture of Anonymous
                does not mean the person is trustable. NEVER.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Of course, we are all human behind these masks, and nature being what it is; sometimes relationships slip
            from anonymity… a lot of the “doxxing” we see is the result. <strong>So boys and girls, think
                twice.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>For all the mistake you did in the past, you might be able to see them while Googling your name. To erase
            yourself from the result of Google please follow the steps described here: <a

    <li>
        <p>DONT BE FOOL BY HONEYPOT</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The less you say, the harder it is for people to figure out what you’re doing. You do not want to give people
            an opportunity to take control of your actions or your life. So, in short; <strong>keep your mouth
                close</strong>.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p></br></p>
<h2 id="authentication">2. Authentication</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use a long, strong and unique password for each of your accounts (see HowSecureIsMyPassword.net)</li>
    <li>Use a secure password manager, to encrypt, store and fill credentials, such as BitWarden or KeePass / KeePassXC
    </li>
    <li>Enable 2-Factor authentication where available, and use an authenticator app or hardware token</li>
    <li>When you enable multi-factor authentication, you will usually be given several codes that you can use if your
        2FA method is lost, broken or unavailable. You should store these on paper or in a safe place on disk (e.g. in
        offline storage or as in an encrypted file/drive).</li>
    <li>Sign up for breach alerts (with Firefox Monitor or HaveIBeenPwned), and update passwords of compromised accounts
    </li>

<h2 id="social-media">Social Media</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Dont share</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Image &amp; video: without removing metadata &gt; https://www.verexif.com/en/
Screenshot of your computer or phone: where we see YOUR actual TIME ZONE</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Dont Enable Auto Login</strong>: If someone gets access to your phone or computer make sure they
            can’t automatically access your social sites. Make sure your computer’s browser “remember” your login and
            password isn’t set.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Use Two-factor authentication 2FA</strong>: ‘double checking’ you really are who you say you are by
            texting your phone a code that you need to enter before you can log in.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Setup Security Answers</strong>: You can set up security questions on your accounts use questions
            that are hard to find out about you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Use a VPN</strong>: Virtual Private Network is an encryption tool. If you want to keep your
            conversations, messages, and calls secure this is the best solution.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Keep Antivirus Updated</strong>: Never go on the internet without installing anti-malware and
            antivirus software to secure your online activity and important data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Change Passwords Frequently</strong>: Always use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to
            make it harder to break. Good, secure passwords shouldn’t be easy to remember AND never use the same
            password for multiple websites because they will all become compromised.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Selective Accepting Friends</strong>: Are they really who they say they are? Do you really know that
            their profile is real and not fake? The safest option is to only accept“friend” requests from people you
            know in the real world.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Turn Off GPS</strong>: Turn off your GPS to keep your exact location private. If you plan to share
            images online turn off the GPS function to protect your safety.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Internet is Permanent</strong>: Always consider that anything you post stays there forever. Even if
            you delete your account, someone may already print/copy your content.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Personal Information</strong>: Careful who you reveal personal information. Always be suspicious of
            anyone who asks for your personal information over any social media platform.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Beware Clicking on Links</strong>: Even if sent from your friends think twice. Hackers love social
            platforms because you are more likely to click on something from your friends.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Block Fake Accounts</strong>: Sadly social media is full of fake profiles. These can be used for a
            number of reasons from hacking or monitoring your activities</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Suspicious Login Attempts</strong>: Social media platforms email you if they feel a login is
            suspicious. Maybe because it comes from a different IP address, a different browser or your account is
            sending spamming posts. Keep checking your emails regularly. If you get a suspicious login attempt to your
            account, change your password as soon as possible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Keep Browser Updated</strong>: Make sure you have the latest version of your browser that is not
            vulnerable to attacks and hackers. Don’t save passwords in your browser because if your system gets
            compromised your passwords can be easily read.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Auto Share Options</strong>: There are options to automatically share posts from one platform to
            another.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Close Old Accounts</strong>: Old social media accounts you haven’t used in years can risk your
            personal data security. Delete account and remove as much personal information as possible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>App Authorisation</strong>: Every time you log in to another site using the option of using a social
            media login you are granting authorisation to your account. They tell you what data this app will have
            access to before you agree but if you stop using that site remember to revoke authorisation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Password Manager</strong>: Your passwords are valuable, so treat them that way. There are a number of
            password manager software available that help you store and organise passwords. This enables you to log in
            with just one main password that then allows you to access all your accounts. Generate a strong random
            passwords to make accounts safer.</p>

    <li>What is the meaning of “Anonymity” online ?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Your information footprint on the Internet is like your body in the physical world: it represents your
        identity, (like the location of the device you’re posting from or the pattern of your language) may make it
        possible for someone to uniquely identify you even when there is no name or other explicit identifier
        attached.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is virtually impossible to remain anonymous on the Internet. As a consequence of the protocols used for
        Internet communication, some details of your device’s setup are communicated to your Internet service provider,
        and often to the site or service you are using.</strong></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
    <li>Most web browsers have <strong>private browsing</strong> modes, but this can be misleading; the sites and
        services you use can still identify you using;</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* IP address
* browser configuration
* browsing history (via cookies)</code></pre>
<p><em>And so … They can still track your activities on those sites.</em></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
    <li>Even if you use a tool like an anonymization proxy to cover your ‘IP address and the timestamps on your

* cookies
* the infos you supply by a query-by-example request</code></pre>

        degree of accuracy, including through;</li>

<ol start="5" type="1">

        <code>if there is even a single link between an online identity and your real self</code>, somebody can submit a
        query using a single identifier to a commercial data-broker service that aggregates data from many sources, and

<blockquote>
    <p>Brave Browser, currently one of the most popular private browsers - it provides speed, security, and privacy by
        blocking trackers with a clean, yet fully-featured UI. It also pays you in BAT tokens for using it. Brave also
        has Tor built-in, when you open up a private tab/ window.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">Firefox</a></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Significantly more private, and offers some nifty privacy features than Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari.
        After installing, there are a couple of small tweaks you will need to make, in order to secure Firefox. For a
        though config, see <span class="citation" data-cites="arkenfox">@arkenfox</span>’s user.js. You can also follow
        one of these guides by: Restore Privacy or 12Bytes</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Tor provides an extra layer of anonymity, by encrypting each of your requests, then routing it through several
        nodes, making it near-impossible for you to be tracked by your ISP/ provider. It does make every-day browsing a
        little slower, and some sites may not work correctly. As with everything there are trade-offs</p>

<p><a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/">VeraCrypt</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>VeraCrypt is open source cross-platform disk encryption software. You can use it to either encrypt a specific
        file or directory, or an entire disk or partition. VeraCrypt is incredibly feature-rich, with comprehensive
        encryption options, yet the GUI makes it easy to use. It has a CLI version, and a portable edition. VeraCrypt is
        the successor of (the now deprecated) TrueCrypt.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://cryptomator.org/">Cryptomator</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>Open source client-side encryption for cloud files - Cryptomator is geared towards using alongside cloud-backup
        solutions, and hence preserves individual file structure, so that they can be uploaded. It too is easy to use,
        but has fewer technical customizations for how the data is encrypted, compared with VeraCrypt. Cryptomator works
        on Windows, Linux and Mac - but also has excellent mobile apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age">Age</a></p>
<ul>
    <li>age is a simple, modern and secure CLI file encryption tool and Go library. It features small explicit keys, no

<h2 id="proxy">Proxy</h2>
<h3 id="http-proxy">HTTP Proxy</h3>
<p>This is a server that acts as a middle man between two communications, a client and a server. The proxy sets in the
    middle and can interact with the request/response cycle.</p>
<p>This component is a good thing for privacy, bypassing filters and any kind of censorship, logging and eavesdropping,
    and another kind of technical restriction, besides traffic capturing and manipulation.</p>
<h3 id="three-types-of-proxy">Three types of proxy</h3>
<ol type="1">
    <li><strong>Forward</strong> : proxies are the ones in which the client sends the request to the proxy and fetch the
        response on behalf, the client can or not know about the proxy but the server doesn’t.</li>
</ol>
<p>This proxy is placed here: <code>Client -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Internet &lt;= Server</code></p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
    <li><strong>Reverse</strong> : this is used behind a network architecture and distributes load traffic to the
        servers. A request goes directly to the proxy and this one handles the request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Can be seen like this: <code>Client -&gt; Internet -&gt; Proxy &lt;= Server</code></p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
    <li><strong>Transparent</strong> : they do not modify any information without any configuration on the
        request/response cycle. This is commonly used by ISP providers for faster responses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s how is seen: <code>Client -&gt; Proxy -&gt; Internet =&gt; Server</code></p>
<h3 id="mitmproxy-overview">MITMProxy overview</h3>
<p>This is an interactive console program that allows traffic flow to be intercepted and more.</p>
<p>Run: <code>mitmproxy</code> (this will start a console on the 8080 port) <strong>this can be change</strong>.</p>
<p>Then, go to your browser settings and set the manual proxy settings to your localhost IP and set the same port as the
    <code>mitmproxy</code>
</p>
<p>When all the setup is done, you can browse and access any website.</p>
<p></br></p>
<h2 id="vps">VPS</h2>
<p>A virtual private server, also known as a VPS, acts as an isolated, virtual environment on a physical server, which
    is owned and operated by a cloud or web hosting provider. VPS hosting uses virtualization technology to split a
    single physical machine into multiple private server environments that share the resources.</p>
<p></br></p>
<h2 id="cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cryptocurrency is an increasingly popular payment method, but contrary to popular belief, it’s not always
        anonymous. With Bitcoin, for example, all payments are completely transparent. If you want to make anonymous
        payments, use a cryptocurrency like Monero, which hides the sender, receiver, and amount sent using three
        different privacy technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whistleblowing">Whistleblowing</h2>
<p><strong>Best Digital Practices for Whistleblowing</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Dont use your work phones</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>To protect your anonymity, use your home phone as opposed to the phone in your office or organization.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
    <li>Don’t work on your home or work Internet</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>If you’re using your home device on a public Wi-Fi network like at a coffee shop, use a VPN, or Virtual Private
        Network. VPNs hide your web traffic and IP address, encrypting your activity.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
    <li>Create accounts with fake names</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>For any email, social media or messaging apps you may be using to communicate about your whistleblowing, create
        new accounts with fake information.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
    <li>Stay on task</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>When you’re working on your whistleblowing by using the Internet at all, make sure you don’t do other online
        activities simultaneously, like checking your email or shopping online.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
    <li>Use a secure browser</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>We recommend using Tor instead of your regular web browser, as it lets users remain anonymous.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
    <li>Use encrypted messaging apps</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Instead of using your phone’s default messaging app like iMessage, use an encrypted app like TextSecure</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
    <li>Check phone settings</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>You may not know this, but your phone is most likely tracking you at all times.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" type="1">
    <li>Here’s how to change your settings:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>iOS: Under Settings, click on Bluetooth and toggle the switch off. Next under Settings, go to Privacy then
        Location Services and toggle the switch to off.</li>
    <li>Android: In Settings, click Connected Devices, Connection Preferences, then Bluetooth and turn it off. Also in
        Settings click on Google, Manage Your Google Account, Data and Personalization then Activity Controls and turn
        it off.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9" type="1">
    <li>Hide your screen</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Hacking isn’t the only way that people can get your credentials; they can also do it the old-fashioned way by
        peaking over your screen15. To hide your web activity in a flash, you’ll need to know the device’s keyboard
        shortcut you can press to hide your web windows or tabs.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10" type="1">
    <li>Here are the shortcuts for the most popular computer brands:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Mac: Command-H
Windows: Windows + D
Chromebook: Shift + Ctrl + w
Dell: Alt + Q
HP: Alt + F4
Lenovo: Ctrl-W</code></pre>
<ol start="11" type="1">
    <li>Close accounts on public computers</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>If you’re using a public computer, make sure to completely log out of your accounts and remove any devices or
        software that you used on it.</li>
</ul>
